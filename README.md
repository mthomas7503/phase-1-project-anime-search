Anime Search Project

#Description

The function of this web application is to allow you, the user, to put the name, or part of the name, of an anime you are interested in into the search bar and it will return all anime related to the name!
The results will show the anime name, rating, number of episodes, and synopsis. Clicking on the photo of certain animes will take you to YouTube where you will see the trailer for the anime.
Please note that this search WILL NOT find any anime containing adult content!
